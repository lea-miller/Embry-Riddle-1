PURPOSE:

Since voice commands within Unity were not working the team resorted to trigger inputs
for the recording of the audio feature

-----
FUTURE WORK:

Since LUMIN Voice commands in the system work seperate from Unity, these features of
the trigger will most likely not get implemented but are kept just in case for
potential future functionality.
